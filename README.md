# Tilt
See which players are more likely to tilt in a game of League of Legends!

Tilting is where a player's emotions can negatively affect their performance in-game, often clouding their ability to make sound decisions. Has a player lost 10 games in a row? Did a player forget to change runes and masteries? Is a player playing a role that they usually don't? Now imagine the Jungler / Mid repeatedly ganking you even though you're already having an off day. Knowledge is power and the players who not only master the mechanical side but also the mental side will win.
